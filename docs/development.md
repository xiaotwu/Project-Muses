# Development guide

Muses is a Swift 6 package with a standard SwiftPM layout, built with SwiftUI, SwiftData, AVFoundation, and Swift Testing. Target platform is macOS 14+.

Home is a mode-switched product boundary. The default Muses provider ranks local library snapshots on-device. The YouTube Music provider uses anonymous Innertube as its baseline and may layer an explicitly authorized, account-matched Web response from the isolated helper. Neither network path receives Muses listening signals.

## Project layout

```
Muses/
├── Package.swift                  # Single package: Muses (app), MusesWebHomeHelper (one-shot helper),
│                                  # MusesWebHomeProtocol / MusesWebHomeCore, MusesTests
├── Sources/
│   ├── Muses/                     # App, Domain, Features, Infrastructure, Persistence,
│   │                              # Services (Discovery, Recommendation, YouTube), Resources
│   ├── MusesWebHomeHelper/        # Isolated one-shot helper executable
│   ├── MusesWebHomeCore/          # Cookie jar, session client, whitelisted payload parser
│   └── MusesWebHomeProtocol/      # Versioned stdin/stdout IPC contract
├── Tests/MusesTests/              # Swift Testing suites (+ Fixtures/)
├── Scripts/                       # Packaging, DMG, icon, yt-dlp bootstrap
└── docs/                          # User docs (also powers GitHub Pages)
```

## Build & test

```bash
./Scripts/copy-ytdlp.sh          # fetch yt-dlp into Sources/Muses/Resources (git-ignored)
swift build                      # debug build
make test                        # full suite: swift test --no-parallel
swift test --filter InnertubeHome # focused parser/request/privacy suite
swift test --filter WebHome       # focused signed-in helper suite
make app                         # assemble build/Muses.app
make app MUSES_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: you (TEAMID)"
make dmg                        # uses the current Makefile version
```

Google OAuth configuration is injected at packaging time through build environment variables:

```bash
MUSES_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=...      MUSES_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
    ./Scripts/build-app.sh --identity "Apple Development: you (TEAMID)"
```

They are never committed, never logged, and are not present unless you inject them. Sign out of the app revokes tokens stored in the Keychain.

## Conventions

- Source code, identifiers, and comments are English; user-visible strings go through `tr(_ en:, _ zhHans:)`.
- Comments explain intent and invariants; no phase-number prefixes, no store-generation "V" labels in naming.
- Engineering, UX, privacy, and verification rules live in [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/xiaotwu/Muses-Polyhymnia/blob/main/AGENTS.md) — read it before changing playback, queue, persistence, packaging, or the signed-in Home boundary.
- Keep Home providers behind `HomeDiscoveryProvider`. Muses and YouTube Music caches are mode-partitioned; guest and account scopes remain physically separate inside each mode.
- The anonymous Innertube request must never contain cookies, authorization headers or locally derived recommendation signals. Continuation tokens stay in memory and are not encoded into saved snapshots.

## Release runbook

### Prerequisites

1. Apple Developer Program membership and a **Developer ID Application** certificate for public distribution (import into Keychain; note the identity name).
2. A `notarytool` Keychain profile, for example `muses`, configured with an Apple ID app-specific password and the certificate's Team ID.
3. A matching Google Desktop OAuth client ID and client secret available only in the local build environment.

### Build a distributable DMG

```bash
MUSES_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
MUSES_NOTARY_PROFILE=muses MUSES_WEB_HOME_ENABLED=YES \
MUSES_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID=... MUSES_GOOGLE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET=... \
    make release
```

`make release` builds the app, signs both bundled copies of `yt-dlp` and the Web Home helper, notarizes and staples the app, then signs, notarizes, and staples the DMG. The PyInstaller-based `yt-dlp` copies receive a narrow library-validation exception and are launched with `--version` after signing; `codesign --verify` alone cannot detect a failure to load their unpacked Python library. It produces `build/Muses-<version>.zip` and `build/Muses-<version>.dmg` using `MUSES_VERSION` (or the Makefile default). Run the full tests and review the artifacts before publishing.

### Publish a release

```bash
release_version=x.y.z # set to the reviewed package version
git tag -a "v${release_version}" -m "Muses ${release_version}" && git push origin "v${release_version}"
gh release create "v${release_version}" "build/Muses-${release_version}.dmg" "build/Muses-${release_version}.zip" \
    --title "Muses ${release_version}" --notes-file "docs/release-notes-${release_version}.md"
```

### Pre-release checklist

- [ ] `make test` green
- [ ] `codesign --verify --deep --strict` on the app and the bundled helper
- [ ] Helper present at `Contents/Helpers/MusesWebHomeHelper`, mode 0700, same-signature chain
- [ ] Fresh install defaults to Muses mode; helper never launches without signed-in Home consent
- [ ] Sensitive-material audit: no cookies/SAPISIDHASH/continuation tokens in logs, SwiftData, or caches
- [ ] App ZIP and DMG both accepted by Apple, stapled, and accepted by Gatekeeper after extraction or mounting

### Troubleshooting

- **"could not find chrome cookies database"** — macOS privacy (TCC) denies the app's access to other applications' data, so the cookie file appears absent. Grant Full Disk Access to the exact `.app` you are running; ad-hoc rebuilds invalidate that grant, so sign with a stable certificate identity during development.
- **Helper "signature rejected"** — the helper must be signed before the app bundle (`Scripts/build-app.sh` handles this ordering).
- **Keychain prompts repeat** — re-signing with a *different* certificate invalidates keychain ACLs; keep the identity stable and click "Always Allow" once.

## GitHub Pages

`docs/` doubles as the site source (Jekyll). Set the repository Pages source to *Deploy from branch → `main` → `/docs`* to publish it.

The family landing page, shared styles, screenshots and Pages workflow now live in [Project-Muses](https://github.com/xiaotwu/Project-Muses). Only that repository deploys Pages. Keep the accessible screenshot tour aligned with the shipped Mac app. macOS source, tests, packaging and technical documentation remain here.

## Build and distribution

`make clean` removes the complete SwiftPM build directory and app packaging outputs.
The GitHub `macOS build` workflow runs serial tests and uploads an ad-hoc signed
Apple Silicon preview bundle. Publishing a notarized distribution requires a
Developer ID identity and notary credentials; public releases use that release path.
OAuth configuration is injected only at packaging time and must not be committed.

Settings uses first-level categories with expanded sections. Shared glass actions
live in `Features/Shared/GlassControls.swift`; controls use capsule shapes while
artwork and large reading surfaces preserve their aspect ratios. Native glass is
availability-gated and retains older-system and accessibility fallbacks.
